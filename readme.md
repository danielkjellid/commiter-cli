# Committer CLI
A very simple cli that standardises commit messages, making commiting more consistent for personal projects.

Usage:
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the folder and run `npm install -g` to install it globally
3. Navigate to your working directory and run `gcom` or `committer` to access the CLI

Limitations:
- Will only push to origin - master
- ~~Will not check if you've made any changes before running the add and push command~~
- Will not handle merge conflicts
